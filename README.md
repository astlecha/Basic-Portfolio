# Responsive-Portfolio
This repository holds a special place in my heart, because it marks the first time I played around with the front end design of a website after learning all of the basics about HTML and CSS.
With no working server or back-end routing, this "portfolio" template can be used for the front-end layouts of any working website. Users can take this as a jumping-off point for basic layouts, customizing visuals and eventually interactivity.

It features an index/home page, a contact page, and a portfolio page. One extra feature I have added is media queries, so that the pages are mobile-responsive. Each HTML page links to the front-end style sheet. Each also has a navbar for navigating to each page (which can later be updated with routes); a main container for the bulk of the page's content; a sidebar with links to social media platforms; and a footer with a Copyright stamp.

The assets folder is what contains the images used for media icon/logos (i.e. LinkedIn logo), along with the CSS stylesheet.

Feel free to contribute to this repository or let me know how I can improve it. Thanks!
